Spring Inspector
================

This project is a first attempt at providing an HTML5-based visualizer and editor
for Spring Integration projects.

To start, launch the `org.springsource.sinspctr.AdminMain` class and in a 
browser, navigate to http://localhost:8081/sinspctr/edit.  From here, you can
choose a spring-integration context file to view and edit.
